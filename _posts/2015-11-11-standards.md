In the course of this project, I realize I am a much happier reader
than writer! Perhaps a standardized set of metadata, elements I would
capture for each journal entry, could help ritualize the act of writing.
Can one 'sneak up' on their own ideas? It is worth an attempt.

For each journal entry, I want to note:

* Author
* Title
* Date begun reading
* Where the book is from (a gift, airport book, etc.)
* Whether I am re-reading the book
* Impressions and questions

To practice, I am re-reading <a href="http://dbpedia.org/resource/Neil_Gaiman" property="creator">
<span about="http://dbpedia.org/resource/Neil_Gaiman" typeof="Person" property="rdfs:label">Neil Gaiman</span></a>'s <em property="rdfs:label">American Gods</em>. I started
reading <span property="purdom:start_date" datatype="xsd:date" value="2015-11-09">09 November 2015</span>. While hard to track, the first reading was
prompted by my <span property="purdom:inspired_by" resource="entities:slab_group" >
<span about="entities:slab_group" property="rdfs:label">colleagues in the Scholars' Lab</span></span>; and happily, my current
re-reading was also prompted by those in the SLab (Ronda has the
brilliant idea for a nerdy book club. We are all in.).


Deep in chapter 7, I am thinking a lot about the deep issues the US has
with <span property="purdom:theme_of" resource="ptag:imprisonment">imprisonment</span>,
<span property="purdom:theme_of" resource="ptag:deity_lifecycle">the life and death of gods</span> or god-time? (Not sure
that's a thing),<span property="purdom:theme_of" resource="ptag:memory"> memory</span> and
<span property="purdom:theme_of" resource="ptag:dreams">dreams</span>--which will inevitably make me want to re-read <span property="purdom:desire_to" resource="http://www.worldcat.org/oclc/436030063">Kraken, An Anatomy</span> by Mi√©ville--and <span property="purdom:theme_of" resource="ptag:loss">loss</span>.

I am always intrigued that Shadow does not recognize
the power of gifts bestowed until the gods alert him. He gives almost carelessly, an after-thought.
