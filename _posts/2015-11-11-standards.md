In the course of this project, I realize I am a much happier reader
than writer! Perhaps a standardized set of metadata, elements I would
capture for each journal entry, could help ritualize the act of writing.
Can one 'sneak up' on their own ideas? It is worth an attempt.

For each journal entry, I want to note:

* Author
* Title
* Date begun reading
* Where the book is from (a gift, airport book, etc.)
* Whether I am re-reading the book
* Impressions and questions

To practice, I am re-reading Neil Gaiman's American Gods. I started
reading 09 November 2015. While hard to track, the first reading was
prompted by my colleagues in the Scholars' Lab; and happily, the
re-reading was also prompted by those in the SLab. (Ronda has the
brilliant idea for a nerdy book club. We are all in.)

Deep in chapter 7, I am thinking a lot about the deep issues the US has
with imprisonment, the life and death of gods or god-time? (Not sure
that's a thing), memory and dreams--which will inevitably lead back to
Mieville--and loss.

I am always intrigued that Shadow does not recognize
the power of gifts bestowed until the gods alert him. He gives almost carelessly, an after-thought.
