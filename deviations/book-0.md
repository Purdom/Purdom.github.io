##Context of project:
delayed flight w/ Eric Rochester, geeking about books (what the project
is)--not geography of physical location of books (tho very cool and will
explore), rather as a geography of mind, the map of how the next book is
chosen. begun as exercise to learn about linked open data;

##Conference Context, themes and issues
openness, text analysis, visualizations, generous criticism, reflections of
privillege, humanities, experimental projects--iterative/in
process/exploratory

##Keynote with Azar Nafisi:
contextualized small project to explore linked
open data through the lens of how I read, expanded to question of if we
map the process of how one reads, can we begin to see broader themes,
issues, concerns that may hint at why one reads? For Nafisi (and very
much for me):
* creativity
* courage
* empathy

##Books Nafisi references?
a way to start adding links out to actual book records
* Nabokov
* James Baldwin
* CS Lewis
* Jane Austin

##Books I am reading now:
* Calvino, If On A Winter's Night A Traveler (book about reading)
* Miller, The Book on Fire (book about books/reading)


##What the project hopes to track (and why?):
* books that have both inspiring the next reading and (inspired by)reflect back on past
readings;
* author,
* publisher,
* translation (yes/no),
* location of publication (us, spain, etc)
* genre,
* date of publication,
* date of reading (start and finish),
* categories (list out)
